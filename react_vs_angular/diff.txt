Here's a clear breakdown of the **major differences between Angular and React**:

---

### 🔧 **1. Framework vs Library**

* **Angular**: A **full-fledged framework** for building web applications. Comes with everything: routing, state management, form validation, HTTP requests, etc.
* **React**: A **UI library**, focused only on building the view layer. You need to add routing, state management, etc., separately (e.g., with `react-router`, `redux`, etc.).

---

### 🏗️ **2. Architecture**

* **Angular**: Uses **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** or MVVM-like architecture. Structured and opinionated.
* **React**: Unopinionated. Lets you structure your app however you want.

---

### 📜 **3. Language**

* **Angular**: Built with **TypeScript** (must use TypeScript).
* **React**: Uses **JavaScript** (with optional TypeScript support).

---

### 🧱 **4. UI Rendering**

* **Angular**: Uses a **real DOM** with two-way data binding and its own templating syntax (`*ngIf`, `[(ngModel)]`, etc.).
* **React**: Uses a **virtual DOM** and one-way data binding with JSX (JavaScript + XML-like syntax).

---

### ⚙️ **5. Learning Curve**

* **Angular**: Steeper learning curve due to complex features like dependency injection, modules, decorators, etc.
* **React**: Easier to pick up and start building, especially for beginners.

---

### 🔁 **6. Data Binding**

* **Angular**: **Two-way data binding** – changes in UI and state sync automatically.
* **React**: **One-way data binding** – data flows down from parent to child.

---

### 📦 **7. Ecosystem**

* **Angular**: Comes with all tools built-in (RxJS for state & async, Angular CLI, HttpClient, etc.).
* **React**: Ecosystem is modular – you pick and install libraries you need.

---

### 🧪 **8. Testing**

* **Angular**: Built-in testing tools with Karma, Jasmine.
* **React**: Uses third-party tools like Jest, React Testing Library.

---

### 💼 **9. Use Cases**

* **Angular**: Great for **large enterprise applications** (like dashboards, CRMs).
* **React**: Popular for **modern, flexible SPAs** (like social media, e-commerce UIs).

---

### 🧑‍💻 **10. Popularity**

* **React** is more popular in the dev community (more flexible and has more jobs).
* **Angular** is widely used in enterprise-level apps (often backed by companies like Google, banks, healthcare, etc.).

| Data Binding   | Two-way                       | One-way                    |
| Learning Curve | Steep                         | Gentle                     |
| Flexibility    | Low (opinionated)             | High (modular)             |
| Ecosystem      | All-in-one                    | Pick and choose            |
| Performance    | Slightly slower for large DOM | Fast with Virtual DOM      |
| Best For       | Large enterprise apps         | Modern dynamic SPAs        |
